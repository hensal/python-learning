  converting integer number into binary in in python:
  
  Method 1:  
 int num=int(bin(number)[2:])
 
 Method 2:
 In Python, binary values are represented by prefixing 0b before the binary representation. 
 It automatically converts the binary to an integer value, as shown below:
a = 0b101
print(a)

Method 3:
The fstrings in the recent versions of Python is a new and efficient way of formatting strings. 
We can use them to carry out such binary to integer conversions as shown below:
print(f'{0b101:#0}')

Method 4:
def binary2int(binary): 
    int_val, i, n = 0, 0, 0
    while(binary != 0): 
        a = binary % 10
        int_val = int_val + a * pow(2, i) 
        binary = binary//10
        i += 1
    print(int_val)  

binary2int(101)
